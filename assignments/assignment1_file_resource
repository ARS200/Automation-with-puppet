# Create a file of your own!
# ---------------------------

# Create your own manifest file (you can name it anything you like, 
# so long as the file extension is .pp). Use a `file` resource to create
# a file on the server with any contents you like.

# Apply the manifest with Puppet and check that the file is created and 
# contains the text you specified.
